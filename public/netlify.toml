  # For static HTML with %VITE_VAR% placeholders, Netlify automatically
  # injects environment variables defined in the Netlify UI if they are prefixed
  # correctly (e.g., VITE_). No explicit [build.environment] block is needed here
  # as it can sometimes prevent the injection.

# If you were using Netlify Functions and needed environment variables for them,
# you would define them under a [functions] or [context.production.environment]
# section, but for simple HTML/JS, this is sufficient.
